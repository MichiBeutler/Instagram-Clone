#  :camera: Instagram Clone

Everyone knows the famous social media platform [Instagram](https://instagram.com). For a school project i tried to recreate this platform and tried to write a web app with similar functions and look and feel.

> Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 exclusively on iOS.

Instagram is build with Django so i used Django too for this project. I hope you enjoy it and mabye learnd something new.
